1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

Thinking in react is making it so that the data displayed is state driven meaning that the user can control the data via UI and the webpage is dynamic by using the state  

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

Class/stateful components are mainly containers for presentational components and usually contain methods and state that drives the components below it by passing said state/methods down through props.

Presentational components are components that are styled and have html type elements that use data from props and are usualy built using functional react syntax

1.  Describe state.

State is the state of your app in which the data is displayed via the virtual dom and can be changed using functional setState which updates state and re renders the component. State is what makes our applications dynamic.

1.  Describe props.

Props is sort of like a HTML Attribute however instead of specifically assigned prop values, props can be a FooBar name. When props are passed down it acts as an object, when calling onto said props you use the dot notation as you would to acess keys on a object.
